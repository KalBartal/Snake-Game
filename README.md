# Snake Game

This is my coding challenge submission for day #20-21 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

This application replicates the popular mobile phone game of the mid - late 90s; Snake. The game displays the score as well as the high score which is written to a file. 

The rules are simple. The snake keeps moving to find and eat food which makes the sanke longer. It cannot collide with any of the walls or its own tail.
